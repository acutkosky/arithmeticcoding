# Arithmetic Coding in Python

This is a simple C extension for arithmetic coding in python. It only supports a binary alphabet.

To install: `pip install git+https://github.com/myuser/myrepo.git@main`. 

See `test_coder.py` for some usage. Note that this file requires `bitarray` and `numpy` to be installed. These are not technically necessary to use the module, but are recommended.
